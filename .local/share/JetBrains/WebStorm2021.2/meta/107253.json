I stare at it LOTS of time per day. I better LOVE how it looks!\n        <br> <br>\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Enjoy!</h3>\n\n      \n","tags":["User Interface","Editor Color Schemes","Theme"],"vendor":"@lcom86","version":"1.0.3.1","notes":"\n      \n    \n  ","dependencies":["com.intellij.modules.platform"],"since":"173.0","size":625100}
